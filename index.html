									<h2><a href="#">About me<br /></a></h2>

								</header>
									<p> I'm a Civil Engineer and currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree. After my bachelor's degree, 
										I had the opportunity of gaining experience in the transportation field (<span>&#8776;</span> 5 years), 
										especially in the Latin-American & Caribbean (LAC) Region. I have comprehensive experience 
										in the transportation field including, highway design, slope-stability analysis and modeling,
										and in a lesser way traffic analysis and modeling, and ground improvement technics.<br/>

										Currently, I'm conducting my research in traffic operation developing an optimization
										algorithm to exploit Connected and Automated Vehicles capabilities to improve traffic 
										performance under the advising of <a href="https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/lily-elefteriadou/" target="_blank">Dr. Lily Elefteriadou.</a>
										My research is motivated by the 
										desire of providing commuters with more freedom of doing other tasks while driving.  
										I like to focus on designing projects that tackle our diverse communities' problems 
										focusing on innovation, safety, sustainability, operation performance, and the economy of the project. <br />
										

										Here are my  RESUME <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">(b&w)</a>/
										<a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Resume_bw.pdf" target="_blank">(color)</a>
										and my <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/CV/Agustin_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV.</a> I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2022. </p>

									<p>The line 1 of the Panama Metro included several changes in the geometry of local roads. This was mainly due to the allocation for the piles that supports the
										elvated sections of the metro. After the piles were located improvement were planned to be made on the geometry of the affected roadways. In this case I
										had the opportunity of getting involve in this stage of the project providing alterntaives to enhance the conditions for pedestrians and mobility of local 
										transit. More space was provide for pedestrian near the transit system (metro and bus), U-turns were design to alleviate congestion on nearby traffic signals.

										and analyzed several alternatives to ensure the stability of slopes and embankments. Furthermore, draining works and anti-erosion planes were developed.
									Moreover I also had the opportunity on helping with some ground improvement technics such as MSE wall, gabions and draining were assesed. Finally I got involved
								on providing some enhacement in the geometry reducing earthworks. </p>

									<p>This was a feasibility of study for one of the more ambitious hidroelectric projects in the country. Its execution is on hold. However I had the opportunity of 
										providing the geometric design of the access roads to complete the project. This roads were mountanious roads whith grades around 12% and above in some cases.
										The roades passed through virgin jungle and it was meant to remain after the finalization of the project providing acces to the project and indiginous groups 
										in the area. In addition to the geomteric design I also completed estimation of the earthworks required for the project and assesemnt on the drayning works on
										required to complete the project. I also did minor collaboration with the geotechincal team to evaluate alternatives to provide construction plans for the project.

									<p>This project was the first big project I had the opportunity to work on. This ambitious  project considers a marine viaduct that sorround the 
										old town of Panama City. Several amenties such as parks, basketball, tennis court were added for recreation. The boulvard also improved mobility
										in an already busy collector in the city. Furthermore this project also helped to provide accessibilty to a slump area in the city. This project
										was awarded the best global project award by the ERN on 2015. My role on this project encompases assistance to the geometric design, geothecnical,
										traffic, and water team. I provided assistance with the traffic signing as well as minor enhancemnet in the geometry of some U-turns.
