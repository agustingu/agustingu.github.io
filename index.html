									<h2><a href="#">About me<br /></a></h2>

								</header>
									<p> I'm a Civil Engineer and currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree. After my bachelor's degree, 
										I had the opportunity of gaining experience in the transportation field  +5 years, 
										especially in the Latin-American & Caribbean (LAC) Region. I have comprehensive experience 
										in the transportation field including, highway design, slope-stability analysis and modeling,
										and in a lesser way traffic analysis and modeling, and ground improvement technics.<br/>

										Currently, I'm conducting my research in traffic operation developing an optimization
										algorithm to exploit Connected and Automated Vehicles capabilities to improve traffic 
										performance under the advising of <a href="https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/lily-elefteriadou/" target="_blank">Dr. Lily Elefteriadou.</a>
										My research is motivated by the 
										desire of providing commuters with more freedom of doing other tasks while driving.  
										I like to focus on designing projects that tackle our diverse communities' problems 
										focusing on innovation, safety, sustainability, operation performance, and the economy of the project. <br />
										

										Here are my  RESUME in <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">modern </a> and 
										<a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Resume_bw.pdf" target="_blank">classic</a>
										format for your convenience. <!--  <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/CV/Agustin_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV.</a>  -->
										I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2022. </p>

									<p>The line 1 of the Panama Metro included several changes in the geometry of local roads. 
										This was mainly due to the construction of the piles that support the elevated sections of the metro. 
										After the piles were located improvements were planned to be made to the geometry of the affected roadways. 
										In this case, I had the opportunity of getting involved in this stage of the project providing alternatives 
										to enhance the conditions for pedestrians and mobility of local transit. 
										More space provided for pedestrians near the transit system (metro and bus), 
										U-turns were designed to alleviate congestion on nearby traffic signals.

									<p>This was a feasibility study for one of the more ambitious hydroelectric projects in the country. Its execution is on hold. 
										However, I had the opportunity of providing the geometric design of the access roads to complete the project. 
										These roads were mountainous roads with grades around [6-12%] and above in some cases. The roads passed through the virgin jungle 
										and they were meant to remain after the finalization of the project providing accessibility to the project and indigenous 
										communities in the area. In addition to the geometric design, I also completed estimation of the earthworks required for 
										the project and assessment of the draining works required to complete the project. 
										I also did a minor collaboration with the geotechnical team to evaluate alternatives to provide construction plans for the project.

									<h4 align="left">Summary</h4>
									<p>This project was the first big project I had the opportunity to work on. This ambitious project considers 
										a marine viaduct that surrounds the old town of Panama City. Several amenities such as skate parks, basketball, 
										tennis courts were added for recreation. The boulevard also improved mobility in an already busy collector in the city. 
										This project also helped to promote accessibility to a slum area in the city promoting inclusion. 
										This project was awarded the best global project award by the  
										<a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/16658-best-project-roadshighways-cinta-costera-3" target="_blank">ENR</a> in 2015. 
										My role on this project encompasses assistance to the geometric design, geotechnical, traffic, and water team. 
										I provided assistance with the traffic signing as well as enhancements in the geometry of U-turns lanes.
