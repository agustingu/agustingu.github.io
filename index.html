									<h2><a href="#">About me<br /></a></h2>

								</header>
									<p> I am an engineering professional with +5 years of experience in the transportation industry. 
										My experience includes highway design, 
										and slope-stability analysis. I also have training in ground improvement techniques, traffic analysis, and modeling.
										

										Recently, I finished my PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Florida. 
										I am conducting my research in traffic operations. I am developing optimizations'
										algorithms to exploit Connected and Automated Vehicles capabilities to improve traffic 
										performance in arterials with my former advisor <a href="https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/lily-elefteriadou/" target="_blank">Dr. Lily Elefteriadou.</a>
										My research is motivated by my extreme curiosity of evaluating the implementation of new technologies in the 
										transportation field, and the 
										desire of providing people with more freedom while commuting.  
										I like to focus on designing projects that tackle our diverse communities' problems 
										concentrating on innovation, safety, sustainability, and operation performance. 
										

										Here is my  <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Resume_OR_DS.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(0, 162, 255);" >RESUME</a>, 
										and <a href="https://agustingu.github.io/resume/Agustin_Guerra_CV__EL.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(0, 162, 255)" >CV</a>.

									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/rf_results.png" alt="" height="300"/></a>
									<h4 align="left">Summary</h4>
									<p> I developed a scraper that extracts data from an advertisement website of real-state in Panama. 
										The data is then preprocessed to develop predictive machine learning models 
										(ANN, RF, Linear, and Polynomial regression). In the future, 
										I plan to incorporate data from different countries in the region and include network infrastructure data in the models. 
										I hope this project will help stakeholders to make more informed decisions or 
										to inform policymakers about the dynamic of the housing market in the region.

									<p> Currently, I am developing algorithms to optimize traffic performance in urban environment. 
										The conceptual framework is applicable for simulation tools as well as for real-world implementations. 
										Different types of optimization paradigms (LP, MINLP, INLP) are studied to 
										minimize travel time considering CAV capabilities. A comparison between an actuated
										control and the proposed algorithms have confirmed the benefits of our strategy. 
										The improvements varies from [7-16%] in travel time reduction.

									<h4 align="left">Summary</h4>
									<p>The line 1 of the Panama Metro included several changes in the geometry of local roads. 
										This was due to the construction of the piles that support the elevated sections of the metro. 
										After the piles were casted in place the departement of transportation proposed plans to improve mobility in the affected areas. 
										I had the opportunity of getting involved at this stage of the project. I provided several alternatives 
										to enhance the mobility and safety conditions for pedestrians. 
										Sidewalks designs were proposed to improve connectivity between pedestrians and the transit system 
										(metro and bus), while for the traffic,
										U-turns were designed to alleviate congestion on nearby intersections.

									<h4 align="left">Summary</h4>
									<p>This project, mainly geotechnical, required us to provide solutions to settlement on embankments
										and slides on slopes.
										We had to characterize the soil type, 
										the type of problem and provide several alternatives to solve the problem. Several methods such as gabions, 
										soil replacement, draining works, shotcrete, soil nailing, and reshaping were proposed. 
										My role on this project was more focused on the creation of virtual models. These models were run in the 
										Slide-RockScience software to evaluate the FS for the alternatives. 
										In addition, I had to create the 3D models for the final drawings.

									<h4 align="left">Summary</h4>
									<p>This was a feasibility study for one of the more ambitious hydroelectric projects in the country. Its execution is on hold. 
										However, I had the opportunity of providing the geometric design of the access roads to complete the project. 
										These roads were mountainous roads with grades around [6-14%] and above in some cases. The roads passed through the virgin jungle 
										and they were meant to remain after the finalization of the project providing accessibility to the project and indigenous 
										communities in the area. In addition to the geometric design, I also estimated the earthworks, and  drainage works required to complete the project. 
										I also did a minor collaboration with the geotechnical team to evaluate alternatives to provide construction plans for the project.

										This project also helped to promote accessibility to a slum area in the city promoting inclusion. 
										This project was awarded the best global project award by the  
										<a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/16658-best-project-roadshighways-cinta-costera-3" target="_blank">ENR</a> in 2015.
